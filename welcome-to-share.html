<h2 id="whatisshare">What is Share?</h2>
<p> Share is a website for sharing. Instead of buying people share.
If you have something you don't need, you can post it up on Share.
If you have something you need then you can browse the <a href=".posts">
what people have posted </a> or post what you need so someone can lend it
to you.</p>
